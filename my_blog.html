    <h2>The start of something special begins...</h2>
    <p>
        The start of something special begins with a spark that comes out of nowhere.
        If you had come to me back in 2019 and told me that in 2021 I would be admitted at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, I would've looked at you and laughed.
        Though I didn't know where my passion was career wise, I would never have envisioned myself being so vested in programming.<br> Looking back at it, I really did not understand coding and what programmers really did. So in 2020 after the release of our national roll out to university and finding that Computer science was what I was called for I was pleasantly surprised. 
        Over that year I had attended some short course on the Emerging Technologies at Strathmore University as my interest in tech grew so I was glad that now I had finally had an interest. 
        I mean the idea of just sitting down with a laptop in hand and creating something out of nothing just seemed crazy to say the least. I came across a video in <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDj-Xo8AlSU" target=_blank title="This takes you to youtube"> youtube </a> that I think expalins better why I finding coding so fascinating.

    <h2>Coding</h2>
    Up until now at 20 years I have become more conversant in python majorly and also HTML, CSS and Javascript including frameworks such as DJango, MySQL and React. 
    I still have a long way to go as this is the first year of me coding but I must say it hasn't been the easiest. Therefore it's why I have decided to create a website just to encourage others as well as myself in this learning journey by sharing my obstacles, achievements as well as what I have learned so far.
